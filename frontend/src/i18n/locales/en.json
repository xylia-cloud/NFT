Simply put, it's an upgraded version of regular USDT that primarily solves issues of liquidity fragmentation, high fees, slow speeds, and the need for bridging or wrapping when transferring USDT between different blockchains. Core features: Unified liquidity pool where all USDT0 across chains share liquidity, with near-zero slippage and low fees (close to 0 gas in many scenarios). Difference from regular USDT: USDT0 focuses more on payments, DeFi, and cross-chain scenarios. It's not replacing USDT but complementing it, especially suitable for multi-chain users and institutions.",
